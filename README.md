  description: "Get heart rate data from your Oura ring",
  parameters: z.object({
    period: z.string().describe("Time period for heart rate data"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ period }) => {
    const dateRange = getDateRange(period);
    const data = await makeOuraRequest('/usercollection/heartrate', {
      start_datetime: `${dateRange.start_date}T00:00:00+00:00`,
      end_datetime: `${dateRange.end_date}T23:59:59+00:00`,
    });
    // Process and format heart rate data
    return formatHeartRateData(data);
  },
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No data found"**: 
- Ensure your Oura ring is synced
- Check that you've been wearing your ring consistently
- Verify your API token has the necessary permissions

**"API token invalid"**:
- Regenerate your token at [Oura Cloud](https://cloud.ouraring.com/personal-access-tokens)
- Make sure the token is correctly set in your `.dev.vars` file
- Restart the application after updating the token

**"Rate limit exceeded"**:
- The Oura API allows 5000 requests per 5-minute period
- The agent is designed to be efficient, but try spacing out requests if needed
